# DISCLAIMER

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This is a research and educational demonstration project only.**

- **NOT FOR CLINICAL USE**: This system is not intended for diagnostic, therapeutic, or clinical decision-making purposes.
- **NOT MEDICAL ADVICE**: This software does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.
- **RESEARCH DEMO ONLY**: This project is designed for educational and research purposes to demonstrate machine learning techniques in healthcare applications.

## Limitations

- The fall detection algorithms are experimental and have not been validated in clinical settings
- Performance metrics are based on synthetic/simulated data and may not reflect real-world performance
- No clinical validation or regulatory approval has been obtained
- The system may produce false positives and false negatives that could be dangerous in real-world scenarios

## Professional Supervision Required

Any implementation of fall detection systems for real-world use must be:
- Supervised by qualified healthcare professionals
- Validated through rigorous clinical trials
- Approved by appropriate regulatory bodies
- Integrated with proper emergency response protocols

## Data Privacy

- This demonstration uses synthetic data only
- No real patient data or personal health information (PHI) is processed
- All examples and test cases use simulated sensor readings

## Liability

The authors and contributors of this project disclaim any liability for:
- Medical decisions made based on this software
- Injuries or adverse events related to fall detection failures
- Any clinical or safety-related consequences of using this system

**Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions and emergency situations.**
